Mostly blender related work over the last month.
Modeled cells for later use.
New technical supervisors innvolved, loots of good ideas pingponged back and forth.
New focus, make custom model for end-cap of crossection model, and create custom shader graph based material to enable dynamic manipulation of the texture.
Made the model in blender, using shape keys / blend keys to move vertices in unity.
    Vertices are a *****....
    Unity only supports 3 edge, maybe 4, had to trangulate. Manually
    
    
In unity:
