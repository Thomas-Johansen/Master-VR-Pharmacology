Since last time:
Gotten the lung model to import properly in both blender and 3ds max.
3ds max was more willing to cooperate with the .obj file instead of the older 3ds max file format
Changed project unity to Unity 6 to make use of never package versions.
Might go for a 2023 version instead, we'll see.
