How many med particles to spawn at a time?
How many per frame
How many to preload?

FOR NOW:
    Generate particle, on generation, assign target cell.
    When activation particle, check if cell is still active.
        If not, don't enable
        If active, activate particle to move to cell.
        
OR : Generate object without spesific target, mostly just to store own gameobject and cell.
    Set target cell and agent on enable
    
    Seems more efficent, no?
    Less wasted cells.
    Buuuut, more processing on spawn then if target is pregenerated.
