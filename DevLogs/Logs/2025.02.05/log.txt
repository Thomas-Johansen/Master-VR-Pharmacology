TODO:

    NavMesh: for å simulere celler som dukker opp etter hvert som luftrøret lukker seg
    Belysning: trenger ikke være perfekt, men må prøve å få forbedret noe ihvertfall
    Revisit smoke sim: Integrate that particles/medicine from the smoke move out in the layers and make the cells go away
    Start work on "controlls": Replace current controlls with more "Scenario" managed movement
        The player will mostly be kept in the same spot, and will be moved by app when nessessary
        Possibly do intro scenario? Start outside body and go inside
        Do Research on how to "queue" up events
        But big buttons in game that control the animation of the cross-section.
    Sound Design: Look into how to do sound events and get sound files that will work.
    
    After this: Moving into the model
    
    PUT IT ALL TOGETHER! (Not yet though, but like thats the goal you know) 
    
    
Thoughts:
    Pure AR version for student use?
    
    BIG IDEA: USE NAVMESH TO HAVE PARTICLES HIT CELLS,

Execution:
    NavMesh: Add "AI Navigation" package to unity
            https://discussions.unity.com/t/a-guide-on-using-the-new-ai-navigation-package-in-unity-2022-lts-and-above/371872
            https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AI.NavMesh.html
        Not as in OpenAI, but the old-fashioned type.
        Fighting with model over what way is up to apply navmesh to correct surface
