# Looking at Asthma Through (Much) Bigger Lenses
## Designing a Virtual Reality Simulation to Enhance  Students’ and Patients’ Understanding of Asthma  Treatment and Medication Adherence

 
This repository contains the code for a Virtual Reality (VR) simulation developed in Unity as part of a Master's thesis in Software Development. The simulation visually demonstrates the progressive airway constriction in a patient with asthma who does not adhere to their prescribed long-term medication.


### Using this repo
#### Unity: 6000.0.24f1 (LTS)
Some files were to big to push to git, and must be downloaded seperately from the "Large Model Files" release in the "Releases" tab.
Extract the folders from that zip file and place them in /Assets/Models


### Controls
In order to start the main scenario after booting up the application, 
the user should first reset the camera for propper orientation, then hold one of the grab buttons while touching the green button to you right.
